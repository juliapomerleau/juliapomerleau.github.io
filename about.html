        <h1> Welcome to my bio!</h1>
    <p id= "bio"> 
         Hi, my name is Julia Pomerleau. <br>
       I play on the club volleyball team at URI, although we are not a fully established team. <br>
            This was the first year that we had a team at our school, and I participated in tryouts with <br>
            around 70 other girls. Here is our team:<br>
            <img src="volleyball.JPG" width = "400"> <br>
            Prior to this, I participated on a total of two club teams during my high school career, <br>
            as well as the high school season. The club team I took a part of was more competetive, <br>
            and we travelled around New England as well as a select few other locations in the US. <br>
            Here's me and my 17 Nationals team participating at a tournament (I am unsure where): <br>

           Although volleyball is definitely one of my favorite hobbies, throughout my childhood I <br>
            participated in numerous sports/hobbies. Here is a list, and I could be missing a few: <br>
            <ul>
                  <li> Basketball
                  <li> Soccer 
                   <li> Karate
                   <li> Volleyball (Obviously)
                   <li> Indoor Track
                    <li> Outdoor Track
                    <li> Cross Country
                    <li> Math Team/Club
                   <li> Girl Scouts
                   <li> Portland Junior Youth Orchestra
                   <li> Solo Violin Lessons
                   <li> Competitive Cheerleading
                    <li> Figure Skating
                    <li> Gymnastics
                     <li> Softball
                     <li> Skiing
                    <li> Piano
            </ul>
            
            As mentioned in the previous list, I was a Girl Scout. I follow through to the end <br>
            of Girl Scouts, beginning in 2nd Grade, and ending my senior year of high school. Here is <br>
            an image of my favorite Girl Scout cookie:
