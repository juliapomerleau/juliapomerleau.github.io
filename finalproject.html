<h1> My final project </h1>
                 <p>
                      For my final code, I did an interactive story that is catered towards kids 
                         <br> of the elementary school level. It can be read to children of a younger age,
                         <br> but, if the child would like to interact directly with the story, they should
                         <br> have decent reading abilities. The story is about life during this pandemic. 
                         <br> I used Khan's images to construct different rooms and ideas. The reader plays
                         <br> a first person role when speaking to "Momma," and plays a third person role
                         <br> when speaking directly to the character. Basically, the reader clicks through 
                         <br> the story, and can go through different outcomes depending on the buttons selected.
                         <br>
                         <br>
